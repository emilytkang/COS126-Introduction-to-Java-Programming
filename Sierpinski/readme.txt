For inspiration, I looked up Sierpinski curves, and I found a website
with information on the Sierpinski Closed Peano Curve, also known as the square
snowflake. http://www.woollythoughts.com/afghans/snowfl.html. The base snowflake design
is essentially a square with four smaller squares rotated 45 dgerees on each
of the four corners. As the levels increase, the size of the snowflakes
decreases in order to make room for more snowflakes. This type of curve is known
as a space-filling curve.
